# Team Formation Typing Indicators

## Overview

TENEX now publishes typing indicators during the team formation analysis process, providing real-time feedback to users about what the orchestration system is doing. This feature enhances transparency and user experience by showing when the AI is analyzing requests and forming teams.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Typing Indicator Publisher Interface

Added a new interface in `OrchestrationFactory.ts`:

```typescript
export interface TypingIndicatorPublisher {
    publishTypingIndicator(
        originalEvent: NDKEvent,
        agentName: string,
        isTyping: boolean,
        message?: string,
        systemPrompt?: string,
        userPrompt?: string
    ): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Modified Components

#### TeamFormationAnalyzerImpl
- Accepts an optional `typingIndicatorPublisher` in its constructor
- Publishes typing indicator when starting analysis with message "Analyzing request to determine team formation..."
- Includes the system prompt and full analysis prompt
- Stops typing indicator after analysis completes

#### TeamOrchestratorImpl
- Accepts an optional `typingIndicatorPublisher` in its constructor
- Publishes typing indicator when forming team with message "Forming team based on analysis..."
- Includes the system prompt and team formation prompt
- Stops typing indicator after team formation completes

#### OrchestrationFactory
- Updated to pass `typingIndicatorPublisher` to both analyzer and orchestrator
- Ensures typing indicators work throughout the orchestration flow

#### AgentManager
- Creates a typing indicator publisher adapter that uses `EnhancedResponsePublisher`
- Uses the project's nsec for signing typing indicator events
- Passes the adapter to the orchestration coordinator

### 3. Event Flow

1. User sends a message/task
2. Orchestration starts â†’ **Typing indicator: "Analyzing request..."**
3. Team formation analysis runs with LLM
4. Analysis completes â†’ **Typing indicator stops**
5. Team formation starts â†’ **Typing indicator: "Forming team..."**
6. Team selection runs with LLM
7. Team formation completes â†’ **Typing indicator stops**
8. Selected agents begin responding

### 4. Typing Indicator Details

Each typing indicator includes:
- **Agent name**: "orchestrator" for team formation
- **Status message**: Descriptive message about current operation
- **System prompt**: The role/context given to the LLM
- **User prompt**: The full prompt being sent to the LLM

## Benefits

1. **User Feedback**: Users see that their request is being processed
2. **Transparency**: Shows the multi-step nature of team formation
3. **Debugging**: Prompts are visible for understanding AI behavior
4. **Consistency**: Uses the same typing indicator system as agent responses

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. Typing indicators are automatically enabled when:
- The project has orchestration configured
- The project info includes a valid project nsec
- NDK is properly initialized

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests pass without modification
- Typing indicator publishing is wrapped in try-catch to prevent failures
- Mock typing indicator publishers can be used for testing

## Example Output

When a user requests "I need to build a new feature for user authentication with OAuth support":

```
ðŸ”” TYPING INDICATOR (start)
   Agent: orchestrator
   Message: Analyzing request to determine team formation...
   System Prompt: You are a team formation analyzer...
   User Prompt: [Full analysis prompt with project context]

[Analysis runs...]

ðŸ”” TYPING INDICATOR (stop)
   Agent: orchestrator

ðŸ”” TYPING INDICATOR (start)
   Agent: orchestrator
   Message: Forming team based on analysis...
   System Prompt: You are a team orchestrator...
   User Prompt: [Full team formation prompt]

[Team formation runs...]

ðŸ”” TYPING INDICATOR (stop)
   Agent: orchestrator
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Add duration tracking for performance monitoring
2. Include confidence levels in typing indicators
3. Show analysis results in typing indicator messages
4. Add support for cancellation during long-running operations
