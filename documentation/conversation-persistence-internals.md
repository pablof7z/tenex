# Conversation Persistence System: Internal Architecture Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

The Conversation Persistence System is the critical data durability layer in TENEX that ensures conversations survive daemon restarts, crashes, and system failures. Built on a filesystem-based architecture with JSON serialization, it provides atomic metadata operations, conversation archival, and state recovery capabilities. The system manages complex serialization of Nostr events, agent states, and phase transitions while maintaining data integrity through Zod schema validation and a promise-based locking mechanism for concurrent operations.

## Core Architecture Philosophy

The persistence system follows several key architectural principles:

1. **Filesystem as Truth**: Uses the filesystem as the single source of truth for conversation state
2. **Schema-First Validation**: All data passes through Zod schemas before persistence or loading
3. **Atomic Metadata Operations**: Uses promise-chain locking to ensure metadata consistency
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Returns null/empty rather than crashing on corrupted data
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct handling for active vs archived conversations

## System Components

### 1. FileSystemAdapter (Core Implementation)

**Location**: `src/conversations/persistence/FileSystemAdapter.ts`

The FileSystemAdapter implements the `ConversationPersistenceAdapter` interface and manages all filesystem operations. It maintains three critical paths:

```typescript
class FileSystemAdapter {
    private conversationsDir: string;    // .tenex/conversations/
    private metadataPath: string;        // .tenex/conversations/metadata.json
    private archiveDir: string;          // .tenex/conversations/archive/
    private metadataLock: Promise<void>; // Serialization mechanism
}
```

#### Directory Structure

```
.tenex/
└── conversations/
    ├── metadata.json                 # Central index of all conversations
    ├── {conversationId}.json         # Active conversation files
    └── archive/
        └── {conversationId}.json     # Archived conversation files
```

### 2. Data Serialization Pipeline

#### Save Flow

```
Conversation Object
    ↓
[Transform agentStates Map to Object]
    ↓
[Serialize NDKEvents using serialize(true, true)]
    ↓
[Write JSON file with 2-space indentation]
    ↓
[Update metadata with lock protection]
```

The serialization process handles complex transformations:

1. **Agent States**: Converts JavaScript Map to plain object for JSON compatibility
2. **NDK Events**: Uses NDKEvent's native serialization with full preservation
3. **Phase Enums**: Stored as strings, validated on load
4. **Timestamps**: Preserved as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch)

#### Load Flow

```
JSON File on Disk
    ↓
[Read and Parse JSON]
    ↓
[Validate with SerializedConversationSchema]
    ↓
[Deserialize NDKEvents with error recovery]
    ↓
[Reconstruct agentStates Map]
    ↓
[Type-cast phases with validation]
    ↓
Conversation Object
```

Critical aspects of deserialization:

- **Schema Validation**: Uses Zod's safeParse to validate structure before processing
- **Error Recovery**: Individual NDKEvent deserialization failures don't fail entire load
- **Type Safety**: Phase strings are validated against ALL_PHASES enum
- **Default Values**: Missing fields receive sensible defaults (empty arrays, maps)

### 3. Metadata Management System

The metadata file (`metadata.json`) serves as a lightweight index for fast conversation discovery without loading full conversation data.

#### Metadata Structure

```typescript
interface ConversationMetadata {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    createdAt: number;      // Unix timestamp
    updatedAt: number;      // Unix timestamp  
    phase: string;          // Current conversation phase
    eventCount: number;     // Number of events in history
    agentCount: number;     // Unique agents involved
    archived?: boolean;     // Archive status
}
```

#### Concurrency Control

The system uses a promise-chain locking mechanism to prevent race conditions:

```typescript
private metadataLock: Promise<void> = Promise.resolve();

private async updateMetadata(conversation: Conversation): Promise<void> {
    this.metadataLock = this.metadataLock.then(async () => {
        // Metadata operations here
    });
    await this.metadataLock;
}
```

This ensures:
- **Sequential Updates**: Metadata updates never interleave
- **No Lost Updates**: Each update sees the previous update's results
- **Deadlock-Free**: Chain structure prevents circular dependencies

### 4. Schema Validation Layer

**Location**: `src/conversations/persistence/schemas.ts`

The system uses Zod schemas for runtime type validation and data integrity:

#### Key Schemas

1. **SerializedConversationSchema**: Full conversation structure validation
2. **PhaseTransitionSchema**: Phase change event validation
3. **AgentStateSchema**: Per-agent state tracking
4. **MetadataFileSchema**: Metadata index validation

#### Phase Validation Pipeline

```typescript
const PhaseSchema = z
    .string()
    .transform((val) => val.toLowerCase())
    .pipe(z.enum(ALL_PHASES as [string, ...string[]]));
```

This ensures:
- Case-insensitive phase matching
- Only valid phases are accepted
- Type safety at runtime

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

The system employs a multi-layered error handling approach:

#### Layer 1: Operation-Level Try-Catch

Each public method wraps operations in try-catch blocks:

```typescript
async save(conversation: Conversation): Promise<void> {
    try {
        // Operation logic
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error("Failed to save conversation", { error, id });
        throw error; // Re-throw for caller handling
    }
}
```

#### Layer 2: Validation Failures

Schema validation failures are logged but often return null:

```typescript
const parseResult = SerializedConversationSchema.safeParse(rawData);
if (!parseResult.success) {
    logger.error("Invalid conversation data", { errors });
    return null; // Graceful degradation
}
```

#### Layer 3: File System Errors

File system errors are differentiated:
- **ENOENT**: File not found - returns null or checks archive
- **Other errors**: Re-thrown after logging

### 6. Archive System

The archive system provides soft-delete functionality with recovery capabilities:

#### Archive Flow

```
Active Conversation
    ↓
[Move file to archive/ directory]
    ↓
[Update metadata.archived = true]
    ↓
Archived Conversation
```

#### Restore Flow

```
Archived Conversation
    ↓
[Move file back to main directory]
    ↓
[Update metadata.archived = false]
    ↓
Active Conversation
```

Both operations use the metadata lock to ensure consistency.

### 7. Search and Discovery

The search system filters metadata without loading full conversations:

```typescript
async search(criteria: ConversationSearchCriteria): Promise<ConversationMetadata[]> {
    const allMetadata = await this.list();
    return allMetadata.filter((meta) => {
        // Apply all criteria filters
    });
}
```

Supported criteria:
- Title (substring, case-insensitive)
- Phase (exact match)
- Date range (createdAt timestamps)
- Archive status
- Agent involvement (pubkey)

## Data Integrity Mechanisms

### 1. Write Atomicity

The system doesn't use true atomic writes but relies on:
- Node.js `fs.writeFile` which writes to a temporary file then renames
- JSON.stringify completing before any write
- Metadata lock ensuring sequential updates

### 2. Corruption Recovery

When corruption is detected:
1. Schema validation fails
2. Error is logged with full details
3. Method returns null (not throwing)
4. System continues operating with other conversations

### 3. Consistency Guarantees

- **Within Conversation**: Single file write ensures internal consistency
- **Across Conversations**: Independent files prevent cascade failures
- **Metadata Sync**: Lock mechanism ensures metadata matches file state

## Performance Characteristics

### 1. I/O Patterns

- **Writes**: Single file write per save, plus metadata update
- **Reads**: Single file read, JSON parse, schema validation
- **Lists**: Metadata file read only (lightweight)
- **Search**: In-memory filtering of metadata

### 2. Memory Usage

- **Active Conversations**: Kept in ConversationManager's Map
- **Serialization**: Temporary duplication during save
- **Metadata**: Full index kept in memory during operations

### 3. Concurrency Behavior

- **Conversation Saves**: Can happen in parallel (different files)
- **Metadata Updates**: Serialized through promise chain
- **Reads**: Fully parallel, no locking

## Integration Points

### 1. ConversationManager Integration

ConversationManager calls persistence at key points:
- After conversation creation
- After adding events
- After phase transitions
- After agent state updates
- During shutdown (save all)

### 2. NDK Event Serialization

The system relies on NDKEvent's serialization methods:
- `serialize(true, true)`: Full event preservation
- `deserialize(ndk, serialized)`: Reconstruction with NDK context

### 3. File System Library

Uses unified file system utilities from `lib/fs`:
- `readJsonFile<T>()`: Type-safe JSON reading
- `writeJsonFile<T>()`: Formatted JSON writing
- `ensureDirectory()`: Directory creation
- Error formatting and logging

## Recovery Scenarios

### 1. Daemon Crash Recovery

On startup:
1. ConversationManager calls `loadConversations()`
2. Reads metadata to find active conversations
3. Loads each conversation file
4. Reconstructs in-memory state
5. Resets execution time tracking

### 2. Corrupted File Recovery

When a conversation file is corrupted:
1. Load returns null
2. Conversation skipped in memory
3. Metadata entry remains (orphaned)
4. System continues with other conversations

### 3. Partial Write Recovery

If write is interrupted:
1. Original file may be corrupt
2. Next load will fail (returns null)
3. Conversation effectively lost
4. No automatic recovery mechanism

## Limitations and Constraints

### 1. Scalability Limits

- **File System**: Limited by filesystem's file-per-directory capacity
- **Metadata**: Full index must fit in memory
- **Search**: O(n) filtering, no indexing

### 2. Consistency Gaps

- **No Transactions**: Multi-file operations not atomic
- **No Checksums**: No integrity verification
- **No Backup**: No automatic backup mechanism
- **No Compression**: JSON files can grow large

### 3. Concurrency Restrictions

- **Metadata Bottleneck**: All metadata updates serialized
- **No Multi-Process**: No file locking for multi-process access
- **Race Conditions**: Possible between save and metadata update

## Security Considerations

### 1. File Permissions

- Files created with process user's default permissions
- No encryption of conversation data
- No access control beyond filesystem

### 2. Data Exposure

- Conversations stored in plaintext JSON
- Sensitive data (if any) is not protected
- File paths predictable from conversation IDs

### 3. Input Validation

- Strong validation on load (Zod schemas)
- No validation of conversation IDs (filesystem constraints only)
- No sanitization of user-provided strings

## Future Considerations

Based on the current architecture, potential improvements could include:

1. **Write-Ahead Logging**: For true atomicity and crash recovery
2. **Checksums**: For integrity verification
3. **Compression**: For large conversation histories
4. **Database Migration**: For better scalability and querying
5. **Encryption**: For sensitive conversation data
6. **Multi-Process Locking**: For daemon redundancy
7. **Incremental Saves**: For performance with large conversations
8. **Backup Strategy**: Automatic backups before modifications

## Critical Code Paths

### 1. Save Operation (FileSystemAdapter.ts:43-73)

The save operation is the most critical path, handling:
- Map to object conversion
- Event serialization
- File writing
- Metadata update

### 2. Load Operation (FileSystemAdapter.ts:75-154)

The load operation includes:
- File reading with archive fallback
- Schema validation
- Event deserialization with error recovery
- State reconstruction

### 3. Metadata Lock Chain (FileSystemAdapter.ts:318-352)

The locking mechanism ensures:
- Sequential metadata updates
- No lost updates
- Proper error propagation

## Questions and Unknowns

### Architecture Questions

1. **Why filesystem over database?** Was this a deliberate choice for simplicity, or are there plans to migrate to a database for better querying and scalability?

2. **Metadata redundancy**: The metadata file duplicates information from conversation files. Is this redundancy intentional for performance, or could it lead to consistency issues?

3. **Lock mechanism scalability**: The promise-chain lock serializes all metadata updates. How does this perform under high concurrency? Are there plans for more granular locking?

### Implementation Questions

1. **NDKEvent serialization parameters**: What do the two `true` parameters in `serialize(true, true)` control? The NDK documentation should clarify this.

2. **Archive vs Delete**: Why maintain archived conversations instead of deleting them? Is there a retention policy or user recovery requirement?

3. **Error recovery philosophy**: Why return null on errors instead of throwing? This makes errors silent - is this intentional?

### Data Integrity Questions

1. **Partial write handling**: If a write is interrupted mid-operation, the file could be corrupted. Should there be a temporary file + rename strategy?

2. **Checksum absence**: Without checksums, how can we detect silent data corruption? Is this a concern for long-running systems?

3. **Backup strategy**: There's no automatic backup before destructive operations. Is data loss acceptable, or should backups be implemented?

### Performance Questions

1. **Large conversation handling**: How does the system perform with very large conversation histories (thousands of events)? Is there a practical limit?

2. **Metadata index size**: At what point does the in-memory metadata index become a bottleneck? Should there be pagination or partitioning?

3. **Search scalability**: Linear search through metadata doesn't scale. Are there plans for indexing or query optimization?

### Operational Questions

1. **Multi-process safety**: The system assumes single-process access. What happens if multiple daemons access the same project directory?

2. **Migration strategy**: If the schema changes, how are existing conversations migrated? Is there a versioning strategy?

3. **Monitoring and metrics**: There's no built-in monitoring of persistence operations. How do operators know if the system is healthy?

### Security Questions

1. **Sensitive data handling**: Conversations may contain sensitive information. Should there be encryption at rest?

2. **Access control**: Currently relies on filesystem permissions. Is this sufficient for multi-user scenarios?

3. **Audit trail**: There's no audit log of persistence operations. Is this needed for compliance or debugging?
