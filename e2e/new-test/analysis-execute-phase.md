# Execute Phase Analysis

## Current Issues with Execute Phase

### 1. **Generic Prompts**
The execute phase uses very generic prompts:
```
Current Plan: [plan summary]
Instruction: Implement the plan. Make all necessary code changes.
```

This is too vague for Claude Code to effectively implement anything.

### 2. **Routing Logic Works Correctly**
The routing system correctly identifies when to use execute phase:
- Simple, clear implementation tasks (e.g., "Implement fibonacci function") → Execute phase
- Complex projects needing architecture → Plan phase first
- Vague requests → Chat phase for clarification

### 3. **Phase Transition Works**
The system correctly transitions from plan → execute when user says "Let's implement it"

## Why Execute Phase Isn't Being Used Effectively

### Problem 1: Missing Context
Unlike the plan phase which builds detailed context from conversation history, the execute phase only passes:
- The plan summary (if it exists)
- A generic instruction

### Problem 2: No Direct Route to Execute
The phase descriptions in the routing prompts say:
```
execute: User has specific implementation task or approved plan to implement
```

This implies execute phase is only for:
1. After a plan is approved (plan → execute)
2. Very specific implementation tasks

For most implementation requests, the system routes to plan phase first, which is actually reasonable for anything non-trivial.

### Problem 3: Execute Phase Implementation
The execute phase initializer:
1. Creates a git branch
2. Triggers Claude Code with minimal context
3. Expects Claude Code to figure out everything from a brief plan summary

## Recommendations

### 1. **Improve Execute Phase Prompts**
The execute phase should build context similar to plan phase:
- Extract specific implementation requirements from conversation
- Include relevant technical details
- Provide clear, actionable instructions

### 2. **Better Phase Descriptions**
Update the phase descriptions to clarify when execute is appropriate:
- Small, self-contained implementation tasks
- After plan approval with clear next steps
- Bug fixes or small features with clear requirements

### 3. **Context Building**
Execute phase should:
- Build context from conversation history
- Extract specific technical requirements
- Include any code examples or specifications mentioned
- Provide clear success criteria

### 4. **Direct Execute Support**
For simple tasks like "implement fibonacci function", the execute phase should:
- Recognize it as a self-contained task
- Build appropriate context
- Give Claude Code specific instructions

## Example Improvement

Instead of:
```
Current Plan: Create a TypeScript function...
Instruction: Implement the plan. Make all necessary code changes.
```

Use:
```
Task: Implement a fibonacci function in TypeScript with memoization

Requirements extracted from conversation:
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Implement memoization for O(n) performance
- Include unit tests
- Follow clean code principles

Specific instructions:
1. Create a new file fibonacci.ts
2. Implement the memoized fibonacci function
3. Add comprehensive type definitions
4. Create fibonacci.test.ts with unit tests
5. Ensure all tests pass
```

This gives Claude Code clear, actionable instructions rather than vague guidance.
