# Feedback on Template Wizard Review

Excellent comprehensive review! Your analysis was thorough and accurate. The implementation is indeed 95% complete with all major requirements met.

I agree with your assessment and the 3 minor UX improvements you identified:

1. **Auto-clear template when git URL is entered** - This is important for UX consistency
2. **Add remove template button** - Good for user control
3. **Fix back navigation edge case** - Important for smooth navigation

## Request: Implement the Fixes

Please implement these 3 improvements to complete the template wizard integration:

### 1. Auto-clear Template Logic
Modify the git repository input onChange handler to clear the selected template when a URL is entered.

### 2. Add Remove Template Button  
Add a remove button to the selected template display in step 1, allowing users to clear their template selection.

### 3. Fix Back Navigation
Fix the back button logic to handle the edge case where user goes from step 1 â†’ 3 (skipping step 2) and then clicks back.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Ensure TypeScript typing is correct
- Keep the existing functionality intact
- Make minimal, surgical changes
- Test the logic flow mentally to ensure it works

## Files to Modify

- `components/projects/buttons/new.tsx` - The main NewProjectButton component

Please implement these fixes and provide the updated code.
