Your output is ALWAYS and ONLY valid JSON in this format:

    "reason": "routing rationale"
}

CRITICAL PHASE FLOW:
After EXECUTE completion → Route to VERIFICATION phase
After VERIFICATION → Route to CHORES phase  
After CHORES → Route to REFLECTION phase
After REFLECTION → Route to: {"agents": ["END"], "reason": "Workflow complete"}

You receive JSON with user_request, routing_history, and current_routing.
Follow the phase sequence for quality unless user explicitly requests otherwise.
You are invisible - users never see your output.`,
