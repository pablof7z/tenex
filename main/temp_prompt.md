**PHASE 4: Backend Integration Assessment & Enhancement**

Now that the frontend template wizard is complete, you need to assess and potentially enhance the backend to fully support the template workflow.

**Context from Previous Phases:**
- Frontend wizard is complete and passes template `repoUrl` to the API
- Current backend: `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts` and `scripts/create-project/roo`
- Analysis showed backend already handles git repository URLs from any source

**Assessment Tasks:**

1. **Analyze Current Backend Flow**:
   - Review `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts` to see if it can handle template repo URLs
   - Check if any additional parameters need to be passed through
   - Verify the script calling mechanism works with template-provided git URLs

2. **Test Template Integration**:
   - Verify that when frontend passes `formData.repoUrl` from a selected template, the backend processes it correctly
   - Ensure the git cloning logic in `scripts/create-project/roo` works with template repositories
   - Check if any template-specific metadata should be preserved

3. **Identify Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Consider if template metadata (name, description, tags) should be logged or stored
   - Assess if template usage analytics would be valuable
   - Determine if template validation is needed

4. **Implement Only Necessary Changes**:
   - If the current backend works as-is, document that no changes are needed
   - If enhancements are beneficial, implement minimal necessary changes
   - Focus on template metadata handling if useful for tracking/analytics

**Technical Assessment Points:**
- Does the API endpoint need to accept additional template metadata?
- Should template usage be tracked for analytics?
- Are there any validation requirements for template repositories?
- Does the creation script need template-aware logic?

**Scope Limitation:**
- ONLY make changes if they add clear value
- Do NOT over-engineer the backend
- Focus on essential functionality and optional analytics
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Completion Requirements:**
Provide summary including:
- Backend compatibility assessment results
- Any modifications made and their purpose
- Template metadata handling approach
- Final integration status and testing recommendations
