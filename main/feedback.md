Great work on the backend assessment! I can see you've identified that the backend already supports template URLs and you've added some valuable enhancements for template metadata tracking.

I'd like to review the specific code changes you made. Can you show me:

1. The exact changes made to `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts` - I want to see the specific code modifications
2. The exact changes made to `scripts/create-project/roo` - particularly how the template metadata is being stored
3. Any changes made to the frontend to pass template metadata to the backend

Please show me the actual code diffs or the modified files so I can review the implementation details and ensure everything looks correct.
