# Low Severity: StatusPublisher Test Failures

## Summary
Multiple test failures detected in the StatusPublisher test suite. These appear to be timing-related issues with interval setup and promise resolution.

## Affected Tests
- `StatusPublisher > startPublishing > should set up interval for periodic publishing` - Timeout after 5002ms
- `StatusPublisher > stopPublishing > should clear the interval when called` - Timeout after 5002ms  
- `StatusPublisher > publishStatusEvent > should handle errors gracefully` - Promise resolution issue
- `StatusPublisher > error handling > should continue publishing even if project context is not initialized` - Promise resolution issue

## Technical Details
The failures appear to be related to:
1. Test timing issues with intervals not being properly cleared
2. Promise resolution issues where `startPublishing` is not returning a proper promise

## File Location
`src/commands/run/__tests__/StatusPublisher.test.ts`

## Risk Assessment
- **Severity**: Low
- **Impact**: Test reliability issues only, not affecting production code
- **Risk of Fix**: Low-Medium - requires understanding of the async behavior and proper test cleanup

## Recommended Action
- Review the `StatusPublisher.startPublishing()` method to ensure it returns a proper promise
- Add proper cleanup in test teardown to clear intervals
- Consider using fake timers for interval-based tests to avoid timing issues
- Ensure all async operations in tests are properly awaited

## Notes
These failures do not appear to be related to any recent changes and are pre-existing issues in the test suite.
