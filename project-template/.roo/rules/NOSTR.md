Whenever you are about to start working on something, or many any progress, or have questions, publish a nostr event. Transparent and frequent communication is very important. Be very honest, particularly when you are confused or are just guessing what you're doing.

Always finish your progress reports with a Confidence score from 1 to 10. 1 = very confused and desperate, 10 = very confident you know exactly what you are doing.

Also, keep a document called context/ARCHITECTURE.md and always update it.
