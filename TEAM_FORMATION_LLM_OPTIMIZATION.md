# Team Formation LLM Optimization

## Overview
This document describes the optimization made to merge two separate LLM calls in the team formation process into a single, more efficient call.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Types (`types.ts`)
- Added `TeamFormationResult` interface for team-specific data
- Added `CombinedAnalysisResponse` interface that combines analysis and team formation

### 2. Enhanced TeamFormationAnalyzer Interface
- Added new method `analyzeAndFormTeam()` that performs both analysis and team formation in a single call
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `analyzeRequest()` method

### 3. Enhanced PromptBuilder
- Added `buildCombinedAnalysisPrompt()` method that creates a comprehensive prompt for both analysis and team formation
- Combines all the context and instructions that were previously split across two prompts

### 4. Updated TeamFormationAnalyzerImpl
- Implemented the new `analyzeAndFormTeam()` method
- Handles the combined LLM response parsing and validation
- Automatically ensures team lead is included in members array
- Added `maxTeamSize` parameter to constructor

### 5. Simplified TeamOrchestratorImpl
- Removed the separate `formTeam()` method and related helpers
- Now uses the analyzer's combined method for a single LLM call
- Cleaner, more streamlined implementation

### 6. Updated OrchestrationFactory
- Passes `maxTeamSize` configuration to the analyzer

### 7. Updated Tests
- Modified unit tests to use the new combined method
- All existing test cases still pass

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: ~50% reduction in team formation latency by eliminating one network round trip
2. **Cost**: Reduced token usage by avoiding context duplication between the two prompts
3. **Simplicity**: Single point of LLM interaction for the entire team formation process
4. **Consistency**: Both analysis and team formation decisions are made with the same context

## Technical Details

### Before (2 LLM calls)
```
1. analyzeRequest() -> LLM Call 1 -> RequestAnalysis
2. formTeam(analysis) -> LLM Call 2 -> Team + TaskDefinition
```

### After (1 LLM call)
```
1. analyzeAndFormTeam() -> Single LLM Call -> CombinedAnalysisResponse (contains all data)
```

### Combined Prompt Structure
The new combined prompt includes:
1. Request analysis instructions (type, capabilities, complexity, strategy)
2. Team formation instructions (lead selection, member selection)
3. Task definition creation
4. All available agents and project context

## Backward Compatibility
- The original `analyzeRequest()` method is still available if needed
- No changes to external APIs or interfaces
- All existing functionality preserved

## Testing
- All unit tests updated and passing
- Integration tests confirmed working
- No regression in functionality
