# Linting and Build Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the linting and build fixes applied to the TENEX codebase.

## Biome Linting Fixes

### 1. Removed Generated JavaScript Files
- Removed JavaScript files from `packages/types/src/` that were accidentally committed
- These were build artifacts that should only exist in the `dist/` directory

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Type Issues

#### Replaced `any` with proper types:
- **TelemetryService**: Created `OtelApi` interface for OpenTelemetry dynamic imports
- **ConfigurationService**: Changed cache type from `any` to `unknown`
- **ProjectManager**: Added proper types for LLM credentials and agent definitions
- **TeamFormationAnalyzerImpl**: Added typed interface for config objects
- **store.ts**: Imported and used proper `LLMConfig` type
- **telemetry.ts**: Used proper `TracingConfig`, `MetricsConfig`, and `LogsConfig` types
- **llm.ts**: Changed from `any[]` to `inquirer.QuestionCollection`

#### Fixed unused imports/variables:
- Removed unused `NDKKind` import from `useProjectStatus.ts`
- Fixed unused suppression comment in `ConfigurationService.example.ts`

### 3. Import Organization
- Ran `biome format . --write` to automatically organize imports according to rules

## Build Status

### Successfully Built Packages:
- ✅ `packages/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ `shared` - Shared utilities and services  
- ✅ `mcp` - MCP server (compiled binary)
- ✅ `web-client` - React web application (with warnings about chunk size)

### Packages Without Build Scripts:
- `tenex` - CLI tool (runs directly with bun)
- `cli-client` - Has build errors in test-utils dependency

### Known Issues:
- `packages/test-utils` - Has TypeScript compilation errors (not critical for main functionality)
- Root build script uses npm/yarn workspaces syntax instead of bun

## Biome Configuration
The project is configured with:
- 4 spaces indentation
- Double quotes for strings
- Trailing commas (ES5)
- Semicolons always
- No non-null assertions allowed
- Explicit any warnings enabled
- Unused variables as errors

## Final Status
✅ **Biome check passes with no errors or warnings**
✅ **Core packages build successfully**

The codebase now has proper type safety and follows consistent linting rules.
