Let me provide you with a summary of what I've done:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI successfully modified the project dashboard column view to exclude tasks from being displayed. Here are the key changes made to `/Users/pablofernandez/projects/TENEX-15czp8/web-client/src/components/projects/ProjectColumn.tsx`:\n\n### 1. Modified Combined Items Logic\n**Before:**\n```typescript\n// Combine tasks and threads into a single list sorted by creation time\nconst combinedItems = useMemo(() => {\n    const items: Array<{\n        type: \"task\" | \"thread\";\n        item: NDKTask | NDKEvent;\n        createdAt: number;\n    }> = [];\n\n    // Add tasks\n    for (const task of projectTasks) {\n        items.push({\n            type: \"task\",\n            item: task,\n            createdAt: task.created_at || 0,\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Add threads\n    for (const thread of projectThreads) {\n        items.push({\n            type: \"thread\",\n            item: thread,\n            createdAt: thread.created_at || 0,\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Sort by creation time, most recent first\n    return items.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt - a.createdAt);\n}, [projectTasks, projectThreads]);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\n// Only include threads in the column view (tasks are excluded)\nconst combinedItems = useMemo(() => {\n    const items: Array<{\n        type: \"thread\";\n        item: NDKEvent;\n        createdAt: number;\n    }> = [];\n\n    // Add threads only (tasks are excluded from column view)\n    for (const thread of projectThreads) {\n        items.push({\n            type: \"thread\",\n            item: thread,\n            createdAt: thread.created_at || 0,\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Sort by creation time, most recent first\n    return items.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt - a.createdAt);\n}, [projectThreads]);\n```\n\n### 2. Simplified Rendering Logic\n**Before:**\n```typescript\n{combinedItems.map((item) => {\n    if (item.type === \"task\") {\n        return (\n            <TaskOverview\n                key={item.item.id}\n                task={item.item as NDKTask}\n                statusUpdates={projectStatusUpdates}\n                onClick={() => setSelectedTask(item.item as NDKTask)}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n    return (\n        <ThreadOverview\n            key={item.item.id}\n            thread={item.item as NDKEvent}\n            replies={threadReplies}\n            onClick={() => onThreadClick?.(item.item as NDKEvent)}\n        />\n    );\n})}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\n{combinedItems.map((item) => (\n    <ThreadOverview\n        key={item.item.id}\n        thread={item.item as NDKEvent}\n        replies={threadReplies}\n        onClick={() => onThreadClick?.(item.item as NDKEvent)}\n    />\n))}\n```\n\n### 3. Updated Empty State Message\n**Before:**\n```typescript\n<p className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-2\">\n    No tasks or threads yet\n</p>\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\n<p className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-2\">\n    No threads yet\n</p>\n```\n\n### 4. Cleaned Up Unused Imports and Variables\n- Removed `NDKTask` type import\n- Removed `TaskOverview` component import\n- Removed `selectedTaskAtom` import and usage\n- Removed unused `projectTasks` and `projectStatusUpdates` from the `useProjectData` hook\n\n## Effect of Changes\n\nThe project dashboard column view now:\n- **Only displays threads** (conversations/discussions)\n- **Excludes all tasks** from the column view\n- **Maintains the same visual layout** and styling\n- **Preserves thread functionality** including replies and click handling\n- **Shows appropriate empty state** when no threads exist\n- **Reduces visual clutter** by focusing only on conversational content\n\nThe modified code is cleaner, more focused, and eliminates task-related complexity from the column view while maintaining all thread-related functionality.","timestamp":1750372014589}
