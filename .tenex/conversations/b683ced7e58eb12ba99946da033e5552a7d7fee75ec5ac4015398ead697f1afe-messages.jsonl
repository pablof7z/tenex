{"id":"1750352757237-coder","agentName":"coder","content":"Okay, I understand the request. You want a new tool called \"research\" that leverages Claude to generate a markdown report based on the current codebase. This tool should function similarly to `claude_code` in how it interacts with Claude, but with the specific instruction to format the output as a markdown report.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the requirements for the \"research\" tool:\n\n1.  **Functionality:** The tool will take a research query as input. It will then formulate a prompt for Claude that includes the research query and a directive to generate a markdown report based on the codebase.\n2.  **Integration:** It will interact with Claude in a similar manner to the existing `claude_code` tool.\n3.  **Output:** The tool's output will be the markdown report generated by Claude.\n4.  **Purpose:** To allow agents to easily generate research reports about the codebase on specific topics.\n\nTo implement this, I will need to define the new tool with its parameters and then potentially update the tool definitions or available tools list to include \"research\". Since I cannot directly create or modify tool definitions in this environment, I will proceed by outlining the steps and then using the available tools to either update a specification document or create a task for another agent to implement the tool definition.\n\nFirst, I'll define the proposed structure of the \"research\" tool:\n\n**Tool Name:** `research`\n**Description:** Generates a markdown research report based on the codebase using Claude.\n**Parameters:**\n    *   `query` (string, required): The research topic or question.\n\nNext, I will update the specification document (`SPEC.md`) to include the details of this new tool.

The research tool is already fully implemented and integrated into the TENEX system. Let me provide a summary of what exists:\n\n## Summary\n\nThe 'research' tool has already been fully implemented in the TENEX codebase. Here's what exists:\n\n### Tool Implementation\n- **Location**: `/Users/pablofernandez/projects/TENEX-15czp8/tenex/src/utils/agents/tools/research/`\n- **Main file**: `tool.ts` - Contains the complete research tool implementation\n- **Types file**: `types.ts` - Defines ResearchOptions and ResearchMessage interfaces\n- **Index file**: `index.ts` - Exports the tool and types\n\n### Tool Definition\nThe research tool:\n- **Name**: `research`\n- **Parameter**: Single required string parameter named `query`\n- **Purpose**: Generates comprehensive markdown research reports about the codebase\n- **Integration**: Uses Claude Code CLI with explicit markdown formatting instructions\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Markdown Output**: Explicitly instructs Claude to format output as structured markdown\n2. **Nostr Integration**: Creates NDKTask events and publishes status updates\n3. **Stream Processing**: Handles Claude Code's JSON output stream\n4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and logging\n5. **Context Awareness**: Uses project context and agent information\n\n### Registration\nThe tool is properly registered in `ToolManager.ts` and available to all agents by default.\n\nThe existing implementation matches exactly what was requested - a tool that takes a query parameter and generates markdown research reports about the codebase by interfacing with Claude Code.\n\n**claude_code:**\nExcellent! The research tool has been successfully created and integrated into the TENEX system. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully created the new 'research' tool definition and implementation with the following components:\n\n### 1. Tool Structure Created\n- **`tenex/src/utils/agents/tools/research/`** - New directory following the established pattern\n- **`tool.ts`** - Main tool definition and implementation\n- **`types.ts`** - TypeScript interfaces for tool options and messages\n- **`index.ts`** - Export interface for the tool\n\n### 2. Tool Features\n- **Single Required Parameter**: `query` (string) - The research query about the codebase\n- **Markdown Output**: Explicitly instructs Claude to format output as a comprehensive markdown report\n- **Nostr Integration**: Creates NDK tasks for tracking, publishes status updates\n- **Claude Code Integration**: Uses the same underlying Claude CLI that the claude_code tool uses\n- **Structured Prompt**: Automatically enhances the user query with explicit markdown formatting instructions\n\n### 3. Integration\n- **Tool Registration**: Added to ToolManager's default tools registry\n- **Import Structure**: Properly imported and registered alongside existing tools\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging\n- **Context Awareness**: Uses ToolContext for project and agent information\n\n### 4. How It Works\nThe research tool:\n1. Takes a user query about the codebase\n2. Creates an enhanced prompt that explicitly requests markdown formatting\n3. Spawns Claude Code with the research prompt\n4. Parses the JSON stream output from Claude Code\n5. Returns the markdown research report as the tool output\n\n### 5. Usage\nAgents can now use the tool like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"research\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"query\": \"authentication system architecture and security patterns\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe tool will generate a comprehensive markdown research report about the requested topic by analyzing the current codebase using Claude Code's capabilities.","timestamp":1750373493607}
