The report identifies 8 key subsystems:\n\n1. **Agent System** - Multi-agent orchestration (well-documented)\n2. **LLM Provider System** - AI model integration (well-documented)\n3. **Tool System** - Agent capabilities framework (well-documented)\n4. **Core Management System** - Project lifecycle management (needs documentation)\n5. **Command System** - CLI command structure (needs documentation)\n6. **Nostr Integration** - Protocol connections (needs documentation)\n7. **Prompt System** - Dynamic prompt generation (needs documentation)\n8. **Utility Systems** - Supporting utilities\n\nThe report includes details on each subsystem's purpose, key components, interactions with other subsystems, and current documentation status. It also provides recommendations for priority areas that need documentation, with Core Management, Command System, Prompt System, and Nostr Integration identified as high-priority targets.","timestamp":1750352745266}
