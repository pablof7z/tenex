        "expectedOutcome": "A detailed report on subsystems to document within ./tenex/, including examples like the agentic system, and a set of specifications derived from the code.",
        "transitionCriteria": "Report and specifications are generated and reviewed (internally by the coder using available tools like claude_code as per standard instructions).",
