{"id":"1750374763178-coder","agentName":"coder","content":"I understand the issue. You're saying the textarea for composing replies in the thread view of the web client is too short, only showing about two lines, and you'd like it to be able to expand to use more of the screen height.\n\nThis sounds like a front-end code modification. I can help with that. I'll need to identify the specific CSS or styling that is limiting the height of the textarea in the thread view and modify it to allow for greater expansion.\n\nI'll use the `claude_code` tool to make this change. I'll provide a prompt to Claude Code explaining the issue and requesting the necessary code modification in the web-client's frontend files.\n\n<tool_use>\n{\n  \"tool\": \"claude_code\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix thread view textarea height\",\n    \"prompt\": \"In the web-client codebase, find the CSS or styling rules that control the height of the textarea used for composing replies in the thread view.

Ensure the change is responsive and doesn't negatively impact other parts of the UI.\"\n  }\n}\n</tool_use>\n\nAfter Claude Code makes the change, I will ask for a review.","timestamp":1750374763178,"signal":{"type":"continue"}}

The key change was updating the `max-h-[120px]` to `max-h-[50vh]`, which allows the textarea to expand up to 50% of the viewport height instead of being limited to 120 pixels.\n\nThe changes made:\n- Changed `max-h-[120px]` to `max-h-[50vh]` - This allows the textarea to grow up to 50% of the viewport height\n- Added `overflow-y-auto` to ensure scrolling works properly when content exceeds the textarea's visible area\n\nThis modification is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes while preventing the textarea from taking up too much vertical space and leaving room for the message display area above it.","timestamp":1750374825807}
