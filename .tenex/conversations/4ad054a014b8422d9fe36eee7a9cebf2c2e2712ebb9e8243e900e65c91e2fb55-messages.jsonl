// Example\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis of `parseTeamFormationResponse` and Related Code:**\n\n1.  **Raw Content Processing:**\n    *   The raw LLM response is accessed via `completion.choices[0]?.message?.content`. This is a standard way to get the text content from OpenAI-like API responses.\n    *   **Potential Issue:** If the LLM response is not *exactly* a valid JSON string (e.g., it includes preamble text, markdown formatting like ```json\\n...\\n```, or trailing text), `JSON.parse()` will fail. While `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` is used in the `callLlm` options, LLMs can sometimes deviate from instructions, especially with complex prompts or lower temperatures.\n    *   **Related Code:** The `think` method directly passes `rawResponse` to `parseTeamFormationResponse`. There is no explicit pre-processing (like stripping markdown code blocks or extra text) before parsing.\n\n2.  **JSON Parsing:**\n    *   `parseTeamFormationResponse` uses `JSON.parse(rawResponse)` within a `try...catch` block. This is the correct way to handle potential parsing errors.\n    *   **Potential Issue:** The `try...catch` block catches *any* error during parsing or subsequent validation. The error message logged (`JSON parsing or validation error: ${error}`) is helpful, but the re-thrown `TeamFormationError` only includes `error.message`, potentially losing the original error type or stack trace which could be useful for debugging *why* the JSON was invalid.\n    *   **Related Code:** The `think` method also has a `try...catch` around the call to `parseTeamFormationResponse`, catching `TeamFormationError` and logging/re-throwing it. This provides a second layer of error handling, which is good.\n\n3.  **String Handling:**\n    *   Basic string handling is limited to passing the raw string to `JSON.parse`. There's no explicit string manipulation (like regex, splitting, or cleaning) on the `rawResponse` before parsing.\n    *   **Potential Issue:** As mentioned, if the LLM output contains anything other than the pure JSON string, this lack of pre-processing will cause parsing to fail.\n\n4.  **Raw Content Processing Before Parsing:**\n    *   There is no code shown that processes the raw content *before* it hits the `JSON.parse` call in `parseTeamFormationResponse`.\n    *   **Potential Issue:** This is the primary area for potential issues if the LLM doesn't strictly adhere to the `json_object` format instruction.\n\n5.  **Logging:**\n    *   There is logging in `think` (`logger.info('TeamOrchestrator received LLM completion.')`) and `parseTeamFormationResponse` (`logger.info('Attempting to parse raw LLM response.')`, `logger.info('Successfully parsed LLM response.')`).\n    *   **Relevant Logging for Debugging:**\n        *   `logger.error('LLM completion content is empty.')` in `think` is good for detecting empty responses.\n        *   `logger.error(`Error parsing team formation response: ${error}`)` in `think` and `logger.error(`JSON parsing or validation error: ${error}`)` in `parseTeamFormationResponse` are crucial for indicating *that* a parsing error occurred.\n    *   **Missing/Potential Logging:**\n        *   There is no logging of the *full raw LLM response* (`completion.choices[0]?.message?.content`) before parsing. This is the most critical piece of information needed to debug parsing failures. Uncommenting `logger.debug(`LLM completion content: ${completion.choices[0]?.message?.content}`);` in `think` or adding `logger.debug(`Raw response content: ${rawResponse}`);` in `parseTeamFormationResponse` would be very beneficial. Using `debug` level is appropriate as the raw response can be large.\n        *   Logging the *parsed* object before returning it might also be useful for verifying the structure, especially during development or debugging validation issues.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n*   The core JSON parsing uses `JSON.parse` within `try...catch`, which is standard.\n*   Basic validation is performed on the parsed object structure.\n*   Error handling exists using `try...catch` and a custom `TeamFormationError`.\n*   **The main potential vulnerability is the lack of pre-processing on the raw LLM response before attempting to parse it as JSON.** If the LLM output includes non-JSON content (like markdown fences or conversational text), the parsing will fail.\n*   **Crucially, there is no logging of the raw LLM response content before parsing.** This makes diagnosing the cause of parsing errors very difficult.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Add logging for the raw LLM response:** Implement `logger.debug` to log the full `rawResponse` string immediately before calling `JSON.parse` in `parseTeamFormationResponse`. This is the highest priority for debugging.\n2.  **Consider pre-processing the raw response:** Add logic before `JSON.parse` to potentially strip common markdown code blocks (e.g., ```json\\n...\\n```) or leading/trailing whitespace/text if parsing errors indicate this is a common issue. Regular expressions could be useful here.\n3.  **Enhance error logging:** When catching parsing errors, log the original error object or at least its type and stack trace in addition to the message, as this can provide more context about the parsing failure.\n4.  **Refine validation:** Ensure the validation logic in `parseTeamFormationResponse` is robust and matches the expected schema precisely.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely source of the problem (parsing failure) is the LLM response containing non-JSON content, and the lack of logging of the raw response is hindering debugging.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will add the recommended debug logging for the raw LLM response to `parseTeamFormationResponse`.\n\n<tool_use>\n{\n  \"tool\": \"claude_code\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add debug logging for raw LLM response\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Modify the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function in `src/agents/application/TeamOrchestrator.ts` to add `logger.debug` for the `rawResponse` string immediately before the `JSON.parse(rawResponse)` call.

This allows chaining errors and providing the original error (like a JSON parsing error) as the cause of the `TeamFormationError`.\n    *   The error message and the `cause` (if provided) are logged using `logger.error`.\n    *   **Finding:** The class *does* include specific handling for error contexts by accepting and logging the `cause` of the error. This is helpful for tracing the root issue, such as a parsing failure.\n\n2.  **Logging for Parsing/Processing Issues:**\n    *   The current logging in the constructor outputs the error message and cause.\n    *   **Finding:** While it logs the *fact* of a `TeamFormationError` and its cause, it doesn't inherently log the *data* that caused the error (e.g., the raw LLM response that failed to parse).\n    *   **Potential Improvement:** The class could be modified to accept the raw response or a parsing-specific context object in its constructor and log that information when the error is created due to a parsing failure. This would provide even more direct debugging information within the error log itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe `TeamFormationError` class is designed to include context (via the `cause` option) and logs this context. This is beneficial for debugging parsing or processing issues when the original error is passed as the cause. However, it does not currently log the problematic input data (like the raw LLM response) itself. This reinforces the need to log the raw response at the point of parsing, as identified in the analysis of `parseTeamFormationResponse`.","timestamp":1750374011541,"signal":{"type":"continue","reason":"Analysis of TeamFormationError is complete, and it confirms the need for logging the raw response at the parsing stage.

This is good for chaining errors and preserving context.\n*   **Finding:** It *does* include the raw content in the error details (`rawContent: content`) when created due to a parsing failure in `parseTeamFormationResponse`. However, this `rawContent` is only logged if the calling code explicitly logs the *details* of the caught `TeamFormationError`. The constructor itself doesn't log the raw content.\n\n**2. `TeamOrchestrator.ts` (`src/agents/application/TeamOrchestrator.ts`)**\n*   **`parseTeamFormationResponse` function:**\n    *   **Finding:** The raw LLM response (`completion.content`) is passed directly to this function.\n    *   **Finding:** The function attempts to extract JSON using two regex patterns (`/```json\\n?(.*?)\\n?```/s` and `/{.*}/s`).\n    *   **Finding:** The function *does not* log the raw `content` parameter *before* attempting to parse it. This is a significant gap in debugging information.\n    *   **Finding:** If parsing fails, a `TeamFormationError` is thrown, including the raw content in the error details.\n*   **LLM Interaction Point (where `parseTeamFormationResponse` is called):**\n    *   **Finding:** The raw LLM response is accessed via `completion.content` before being passed to `parseTeamFormationResponse`.\n\n**3. LLM Provider Implementations (e.g., `OpenAIAdapter.ts`, `AnthropicProvider.ts`)**\n*   **Finding:** The `LLMLogger` is used, and it *does* have verbose logging (`debug` level) that can include the full raw response from the LLM API.\n*   **Finding:** The `OpenAIAdapter` processes the raw response by extracting `message.content` from the `choices[0].message`.\n*   **Finding:** The `AnthropicProvider` has a `formatToolCallsAsText` method, suggesting some transformation of the raw response structure (specifically tool call information) might occur before the final text content is available or returned. The raw response from Anthropic likely contains a structured object with `content` which can be a string or an array of content blocks (including tool use).\n*   **Finding:** The `BaseLLMProvider` *does not* have a `formatToolCallsAsText` method; this logic is provider-specific (e.g., in `AnthropicProvider`).\n*   **Finding:** The `BaseLLMProvider` includes logging (`this.logger.debug`) for the *completion result* before returning it. If the LLM provider returns the raw text content in a property like `content`, this logging *should* capture it, provided debug logging is enabled.\n\n**Summary of Findings on Logging for Debugging Parsing Issues:**\n\n*   The `TeamFormationError` preserves raw content in its details, but logging the error object itself is required to see it.\n*   **Crucially, the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function *does not* log the raw input string it receives before attempting parsing.** This is the most direct point where logging the problematic input is needed.\n*   The LLM providers *do* have debug logging for the final completion result they return, which *should* include the raw text content passed to `parseTeamFormationResponse`, provided debug logging is enabled. This logging happens *before* parsing but *after* the provider has potentially extracted or formatted the content from the provider-specific raw API response structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most significant gap identified for debugging the JSON parsing issue is the lack of logging of the raw input string *within* the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function itself. While LLM provider logging and the `TeamFormationError` provide some context, logging the exact string being parsed is essential for diagnosing why the regex or `JSON.parse` is failing.\n\nThe current analysis has confirmed that:\n1.  The raw LLM response text is available (`completion.content`).\n2.  It is passed to `parseTeamFormationResponse`.\n3.  It is *not* logged there before parsing.\n4.  LLM providers *do* log the final extracted content at debug level, but logging it right at the point of parsing is more targeted.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to add logging of the raw input string at the beginning of the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nImplement logging of the raw `content` parameter at the beginning of the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function in `TeamOrchestrator.ts`.","timestamp":1750374068008,"signal":{"type":"continue"}}

This is necessary because the Anthropic API returns tool calls in a structured format (an array of objects), but the interaction model for tool use often involves presenting these tool calls back to the LLM as part of the conversation history, typically in a specific text format that the LLM is trained to understand.\n\n**How it Processes Tool Call Information:**\n\nBased on the provided code snippet, the `formatToolCallsAsText` method appears to do the following:\n\n1.  **Iterate through Tool Calls:** It takes an array of tool call objects as input. It then iterates through each tool call in this array.\n2.  **Extract Information:** For each tool call, it extracts key information:\n    *   `tool_use_id`: A unique identifier for this specific tool call instance.\n    *   `name`: The name of the tool being called.\n    *   `input`: The input parameters for the tool call, typically a JSON object.\n3.  **Format as Text:** It constructs a string representation for each tool call. The format used is:\n    ```\n    <tool_code>${tool_use_id}</tool_code>\n    <tool_name>${name}</tool_name>\n    <tool_inputs>${JSON.stringify(input)}</tool_inputs>\n    ```\n    This format uses XML-like tags (`<tool_code>`, `<tool_name>`, `<tool_inputs>`) to clearly delineate the different parts of the tool call. The `input` object is converted into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify`.\n4.  **Combine Formatted Calls:** It joins the string representations of all tool calls together, separated by newlines, to create a single string output.\n\n**Significance to the Problem:**\n\nThis method is relevant because it demonstrates how the Anthropic provider handles structured tool call data from the API. While the primary issue is parsing the *response* from the LLM (which might *contain* tool calls as JSON), understanding how tool calls are *formatted* to be sent back to the LLM can provide context about the overall interaction flow and expected data formats within the system. It shows that JSON serialization (`JSON.stringify`) is used for tool inputs when formatting them for the LLM, which is consistent with the expectation that the LLM might output JSON for tool calls in its response.\n\nHowever, this method itself does not directly address the parsing of the *LLM's response* which is where the current error occurs. The error happens when trying to parse the LLM's output to identify the team formation structure, not when formatting tool calls to send *to* the LLM.","timestamp":1750374072342,"signal":{"type":"continue","reason":"I have analyzed the `formatToolCallsAsText` method.
