{"id":"1750373938959-debugger","agentName":"debugger","content":"Okay, I understand the problem. The team formation failed because the LLM generated invalid JSON. The specific error is \"Unterminated string\", and the raw content shows an incomplete string within the \"members\" array: `\"debugger\\\"\\n    ]\\n  \\\",`. This is where the JSON parsing failed.\n\nHere are a few possible sources of this problem:\n\n1.  **LLM Generation Error:** The most likely cause is that the LLM itself stopped generating the JSON mid-string. This could be due to context window limitations, internal model issues, or hitting a token limit during generation.\n2.  **Truncation during Transmission:** There might have been an issue during the transmission of the LLM's response, causing it to be truncated before the complete JSON was received.\n3.  **Parsing Logic Error:** Less likely, but possible, there could be a bug in the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function that incorrectly handles the incoming string, leading to a misinterpretation of the JSON structure.\n\nBased on the provided error and raw content, the most probable cause is an **LLM Generation Error**. The raw content clearly shows the JSON is cut off within a string literal.\n\nTo validate this, I'll examine the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function and surrounding code to see how the LLM response is received and parsed. I'll also consider if there are any logging mechanisms that could show the full, un-truncated response from the LLM before it reaches the parsing stage.\n\nI will use the `claude_code` tool to analyze the relevant code files and look for potential issues in the parsing logic or how the LLM response is handled.\n\n<tool_use>\n{\n  \"tool\": \"claude_code\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"title\": \"Analyze JSON parsing and LLM response handling\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Analyze the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function in `src/agents/application/TeamOrchestrator.ts` and any related code that handles the LLM's raw response for team formation.

{"id":"1750374095526-debugger-tools","agentName":"debugger","content":"Here are the results:\n\n**claude_code:**\nBased on my analysis of the code, I've identified several potential issues in the `parseTeamFormationResponse` function:\n\n## Issues Found:\n\n1. **JSON Extraction Regex**: The current regex pattern for extracting JSON has a potential issue. When using `match(/```json\\n?(.*?)\\n?```/s)`, if the JSON contains a closing brace followed by backticks without a newline, it might not match correctly.\n\n2. **Missing Raw Response Logging**: While there's debug logging for the raw JSON response, there's no logging of the original LLM response content before JSON extraction. This makes it difficult to diagnose truncation issues.\n\n3. **Error Context**: When JSON parsing fails, the error includes `rawContent` in the details, but this isn't logged at a higher level for debugging.\n\n## Recommendations:\n\n1. **Add comprehensive logging before parsing**:\n```typescript\norchestrationLogger.debug(`Full LLM response content: ${content.substring(0, 5000)}`, \"verbose\");\norchestrationLogger.debug(`Response length: ${content.length} characters`, \"verbose\");\n```\n\n2. **Improve JSON extraction regex**:\n```typescript\nconst jsonMatch = content.match(/```json\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```/) || content.match(/{[\\s\\S]*}/);\n```\n\n3. **Add response validation**:\n```typescript\n// Check if response seems truncated\nif (content.length > 4000 && !content.trim().endsWith('}') && !content.includes('```')) {\n    orchestrationLogger.warning(\"Response may be truncated - doesn't end with expected closing\");\n}\n```\n\n4. **Enable verbose logging in LLMLogger**: The system has comprehensive logging capabilities but they might not be enabled. Check if `LLMLogger.setVerboseMode(true)` is being called.\n\nThe truncation issue is likely happening at the LLM provider level where the response is being cut off, possibly due to token limits or response size constraints. The logging improvements would help identify exactly where the truncation occurs.","timestamp":1750374095526}
