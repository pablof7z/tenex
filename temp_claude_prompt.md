# PHASE 3: Frontend Template Wizard Integration - Code Review and Validation

## Task Overview
I need you to review the existing implementation of the template wizard integration in the NewProjectButton component and validate that it meets all the specified requirements from the task.

## Context
The template system components are already complete:
- `types/template.ts` - Template type definitions
- `hooks/useTemplates.ts` - Hook for fetching templates from nostr
- `components/templates/TemplateSelector.tsx` - Template selection UI component

The integration has been implemented in `components/projects/buttons/new.tsx` but I need you to review it against the requirements.

## Requirements to Validate

### 1. Component Imports
✅ Check that these imports are present:
- `TemplateSelector` from `'components/templates/TemplateSelector'`
- `useTemplates` from `'hooks/useTemplates'` (if used directly)
- `NostrTemplate` from `'types/template'`

### 2. Wizard State Management
✅ Verify these state variables exist:
- `currentStep` state (1: Project Details, 2: Template Selection, 3: Confirmation)
- `selectedTemplate` state to track chosen template
- Step navigation functions (`nextStep`, `prevStep`, `goToStep`)

### 3. Conditional Logic
✅ Confirm these behaviors:
- Template selection step shows ONLY when `formData.repoUrl` is empty
- Template step is skipped when git URL is provided
- `selectedTemplate` is cleared when user enters a git URL

### 4. Form Rendering
✅ Check that the wizard has:
- Step 1: Existing project form fields (name, description, hashtags, git repo)
- Step 2: Template selection using `TemplateSelector` component (conditional)
- Step indicators and navigation buttons
- "Back" and "Next/Create" buttons

### 5. Form Submission
✅ Verify that:
- `selectedTemplate.repoUrl` is used as the git repository when template is selected
- Template selection takes precedence over manual git URL
- Template information is passed in the API call

### 6. Technical Requirements
✅ Ensure:
- Existing form validation and error handling is maintained
- All existing functionality for users who provide git URLs is preserved
- Conditional rendering for wizard steps works correctly
- Proper state management for template selection
- Proper TypeScript typing for new state variables

### 7. UI/UX Requirements
✅ Check for:
- Clear step progression indicators
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Ability to go back and modify selections
- Existing styling and design patterns are maintained
- Template selection shows only when appropriate

## Your Tasks

1. **Review the current implementation** in `components/projects/buttons/new.tsx`
2. **Validate against each requirement** listed above
3. **Identify any missing functionality** or issues
4. **Suggest improvements** if needed
5. **Test the logic flow** mentally to ensure it works correctly

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Does the wizard flow work correctly: Project Details → Template Selection (if no git URL) → Create Project?
2. Is the template selection properly integrated with the form state?
3. Are all edge cases handled (user enters git URL after selecting template, etc.)?
4. Is the UI/UX intuitive and follows the existing design patterns?
5. Are there any TypeScript typing issues?
6. Is the form validation working correctly for all scenarios?

## Expected Output

Provide a detailed analysis covering:
1. **Compliance Status**: Which requirements are met vs missing
2. **Code Quality Assessment**: Any issues with the current implementation
3. **Functionality Gaps**: What needs to be added or fixed
4. **Recommendations**: Specific improvements or changes needed
5. **Next Steps**: What should be done to complete the integration

Please be thorough in your review and provide specific code examples for any issues or improvements you identify.
