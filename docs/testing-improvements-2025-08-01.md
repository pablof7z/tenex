# TENEX Testing Infrastructure Improvements - August 1, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the incremental improvements made to the TENEX testing infrastructure to enhance system reliability and testability.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. MockLLMService Updates (Critical Fix)

**Problem**: The MockLLMService was using an outdated interface that didn't match the multi-llm-ts v4 API, causing all E2E tests to fail.

**Solution**:
- Updated MockLLMService to implement the new `complete()` and `stream()` methods
- Fixed response format to match expected `{ type, content, toolCalls }` structure
- Updated type imports from `LLMMessage` to `Message`
- Added routing-decisions scenario for orchestrator tests

**Impact**: Restored E2E test functionality and enabled deterministic testing of LLM interactions.

### 2. AgentExecutor Unit Tests

**Problem**: The core AgentExecutor class had 0% test coverage despite being critical for agent execution.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive unit tests for AgentExecutor
- Tested backend selection logic (claude, reason-act, routing)
- Added tests for execution flow with mocked backends
- Implemented error handling test scenarios

**Impact**: Increased confidence in the agent execution pipeline and backend selection logic.

### 3. Event Handler Unit Tests

**Problem**: All event handlers (newConversation, reply, task, project) had 0% test coverage.

**Solution**:
- Created tests for newConversation handler
  - Conversation creation flow
  - Agent selection logic
  - Error handling scenarios
- Created tests for reply handler
  - Message addition flow
  - Agent continuation logic
  - Context preservation

**Impact**: Improved reliability of core user interaction flows and error recovery.

## Testing Gaps Still Remaining

### High Priority
1. **ReasonActLoop** - Core execution logic with 0% coverage
2. **ClaudeBackend** - LLM integration with minimal coverage
3. **Nostr Integration** - Publisher and client components untested
4. **Daemon Components** - ProjectManager and EventMonitor lack tests

### Medium Priority
1. **Tool Implementations** - Several tools lack comprehensive tests
2. **MCP Service** - Integration and adapter components need coverage
3. **State Persistence** - Known issues need resolution and tests
4. **Tracing/Logging** - Infrastructure components need coverage

### Low Priority
1. **CLI Commands** - Command implementations lack tests
2. **Utility Functions** - Various helpers need coverage
3. **Performance Tests** - No load or performance testing framework

## Next Steps

1. **Fix State Persistence Issues**: Address the known serialization problems
2. **Test Critical Execution Paths**: Add tests for ReasonActLoop and ClaudeBackend
3. **Integration Test Suite**: Create comprehensive integration tests
4. **Error Recovery Scenarios**: Expand E2E tests for failure modes

## Summary

The testing infrastructure has been improved with targeted, incremental changes that address critical gaps. The MockLLMService fix was essential for enabling deterministic testing, while the new unit tests for AgentExecutor and event handlers provide coverage for core system components.

Future improvements should focus on the execution backends and integration points to ensure system reliability under various failure scenarios.
