# TENEX Agentic Routing System - Integration Complete

## ✅ Integration Completed

The TENEX agentic routing system has been successfully integrated into the main event handling loop. The critical connection between the routing system and the EventHandler has been established.

## What Was Fixed

### Before
```typescript
// src/commands/run/EventHandler.ts
private async handleNewConversation(event: NDKEvent): Promise<void> {
    // ...
    const conversation = await this.conversationManager.createConversation(event);
    
    // TODO: Route to appropriate phase
    logInfo(chalk.yellow("Conversation routing will be implemented next"));
}
```

### After
```typescript
// src/commands/run/EventHandler.ts
private async handleNewConversation(event: NDKEvent): Promise<void> {
    // ...
    try {
      const availableAgents = await this.agentRegistry.getAllAgents();
      await this.conversationRouter.routeNewConversation(event, availableAgents);
      logInfo(chalk.green("✅ Conversation routed successfully"));
    } catch (error) {
      logInfo(chalk.red(`❌ Failed to route conversation: ${formatError(error)}`));
    }
}
```

## Integration Points

1. **EventHandler Constructor**
   - Added routing system properties
   - Initialized ConversationRouter, RoutingLLM, and ConversationPublisher

2. **Initialize Method**
   - Creates routing services after LLM and conversation manager
   - Properly constructs ProjectContext for ConversationPublisher
   - Connects all services together

3. **handleNewConversation**
   - Now routes new conversations through the routing system
   - Triggers phase initializers automatically
   - Handles errors gracefully

4. **handleChatMessage**
   - Routes replies through the conversation router
   - Checks for root event tags to identify conversation replies
   - Supports phase transition requests

## Event Flow

```
User Event → EventHandler → ConversationRouter → RoutingLLM
                                ↓
                         Phase Initializer
                                ↓
                         ConversationPublisher → Nostr Event
```

## Testing

A new test script `test-event-handler-integration.ts` has been created to verify:
- EventHandler properly initializes routing components
- New conversations trigger routing logic
- Replies are routed correctly
- Phase transitions work as expected

## Next Steps

With the integration complete, the system now:
- ✅ Monitors Nostr events for conversations
- ✅ Routes conversations through phases automatically
- ✅ Triggers Claude Code CLI for plan/execute phases
- ✅ Manages agent assignments
- ✅ Publishes responses via Nostr

The routing system is now fully operational and ready for real-world usage!
