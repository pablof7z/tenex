The following agents are available and may be working on related tasks:\n\n- **debugger**: An experience debugging machine. (Role: Inquisitive debugger)\n- **christ**: Christ is a very creative thinker, coming up with parallel-thinking, highly-creative ideas. (Role: Dreamer and wild thinker)\n\n### Collaboration Guidelines\n- You can mention other agents using @agent-name when you need their expertise\n- Be aware that multiple agents may be working in parallel\n- Coordinate through clear communication when working on shared components\n- Respect each agent's specialization and defer to their expertise when appropriate\n\n## Project Rules\n\nThe following rules and guidelines apply to this project:\n\n### Inventory\n*Instruct LLMs to preserve a map/inventory of all the parts of the codebase*\n\nMaintain an accurate inventory of all code files within the `src/` directory, providing a concise one-line summary clearly stating each file's responsibility and scope. Immediately update this inventory whenever you create, significantly modify, or delete files.\n\n**Inventory Guidelines for LLMs:**\n\n- **Clearly state the file's purpose:** Each entry should explicitly describe what the file does, its main responsibility, and scope.\n- **Avoid vagueness:** Entries must precisely communicate responsibilities and usage context to enable quick understanding by other LLMs without additional context.\n\n### Inventory Format:\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── path/to/file.ext  # concise, explicit one-liner summarizing file responsibility and scope\n```\n\n### Current Inventory (Update Immediately):\n\n(empty, replace this placeholder with the current inventory)\n\n\n### Additional Rules\n\n## Project Rules\n\n### Inventory\n*Instruct LLMs to preserve a map/inventory of all the parts of the codebase*\nMaintain an accurate inventory of all code files within the `src/` directory, providing a concise one-line summary clearly stating each file's responsibility and scope.
