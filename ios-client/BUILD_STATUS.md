- Real-time updates are handled through Nostr subscriptions

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Xcode project file needs to be properly generated (use Xcode's "Create new project" and add existing files)
2. Some NDKSwift API calls might need adjustment based on the latest library version
3. Maestro tests require a running iOS simulator

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Create proper Xcode project file through Xcode GUI
2. Test the app on real devices
3. Implement remaining voice features
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Optimize performance for large datasets
